	text | The Color Purple (1985 Spielberg film).

Particularly two scenes, one where Celie (Whoopi Goldberg) is imagining her children living in Africa while shaving Mister (Danny Glover), and the one where Shug Avery (Margaret Avery) sings "God is tryin to tell you somethin" while quickly walking to her father's church. Any of the many magical scenes with Shug or Celie's sister Nettie (Akosua Busia) as well.

	text | I feel like Imma put this up here and people are gonna be like "huh?"

But hear me out:  "Excalibur" 1983 Dir: John Boorman. A 3 hour-long nearly flawless adaptation of Sir Thomas Mallory 15th Century masterwork "La Mort D'Arthur" (The Death of Arthur) Which is the tale of King Arthur we know today from the sword in the stone, Merlin, the betrayal by Lancelot and Lady Genevieve, the quest for the holy grail and his eventual demise at the hand of his bastard son.

It has Merlin's doomed  "Charm of Making" which nearly every fan of this film knows by heart.

Young (and hawt) Dame Helen Mirren as Morgana the witch.

Best. Movie. Ever.

	text | The 13th Warrior. I am little biased because I read the short story first, which was inspired by real life writings. The fact that an Arabic scribe ventured onto a Viking longship and wrote about their culture is fascinating to me. Combine that with the absolutely genius way that superstition is handled alongside tradition, comedy, tragedy and language in the film and I could watch this film for infinity and still love it. So many masterful scenes and done in a way where you 100% believe any of it could�ve happened. The cinematography and score are top notch and it�s a shame that many ppl see Antonio Banderas (who holds his own in the film) and immediately write it off as a cheap action flick. If you love history or are tired of the same old film, read Crichton�s �Eaters of the Dead� short story then watch this.

	text | ##Scott Pilgrim vs The World 

The one movie that took my breath away the first day I saw it and never fails to give me the same experience with every new viewing. It�s my favorite movie of all time, from the plot to the characterization, cinematography, pacing, script, casting, themes, references, costume design, score, even color pallets! 

Edgar Wright is *in my opinion* one of the most brilliant and creative directors to date, with Scott Pilgrim being some of his best work. It�s always been my go-to comfort movie that I watch at least once a month or every other month to this very day. 

Truly a magical experience that I have yet to find with any other film.
