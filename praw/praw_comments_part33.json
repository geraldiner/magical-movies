So, yesterday was that rare treasure box of memories of 'first time movies'.\n\nTo know that my reply made you treasure your memories is probably a delightful surprise for me. I am truly honoured that I reached out. But having said, it's a bittersweet thing because I of course didn't know this. Your father sounds like an absolute treasure of a person. It must have been very, very hard for you. May he rest in peace, and may his wonderfulness inspire you, always. I am truly, truly sorry for your loss. If you ever need a person to listen, you can reach out to me if you want. Sometimes, a listening stranger is worth more than you can imagine.\n\nI recommended Pleasantville to just about every human alive today. Thank you again! Nothing you do will ever be insignificant.

I am only 1/3 of the way through William Goldmans version and so far I've loved how they've provided more depth and backstory into the characters and why they are the way that there are (i.e. the Count has a wife, Buttercup has parents, Prince Humperdink is skilled in combat because he trains for hours every day by killing animals(which he finds boring), and he's interested in Buttercup because of her beauty and the fact that he had a date with a bald woman and was willing to choose anyone to marry, even a peasant). I love that Buttercup acts like a teenager when confronting Westley at her cottage in the book instead of acting/looking like an annoying 21 year old (granted though, this part of the movie is still amazing).\n\nSo yeah, I probably shouldn't have judged it so early and was only making an observation on what I've read so far, so thank you for humbling me, lol. It's also given me more incentive/inspiration to read more :)",
