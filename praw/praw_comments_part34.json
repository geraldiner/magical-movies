It's kind of half way between Costco Pizza and Stouffer's Microwave Pizza. The crust is too bread, the sauce too spicy to mask the tomato, the cheese tastes a little stale. It's a decent meal if you are in the park and in a hurry, for a while it was one of the better meal options in Disneyland proper. Disneyland proper has not really had the best cuisine since the late 80s though. Apart from their signature foods (i.e. Turkey leg, Pickle, popcorn, corn dog) only in the last decade or so have options started really improving. The food at DCA has been far better. Though the food at Galaxy's Edge definitely changes this. It's pretty amazing. \n\nIf you are in Disneyland and craving pizza, I suggest either [Naples](https://yelp.to/fERjZKbtHfb) in Downtown Disney (they have an express side too called Napolini), or if you are willing to walk outside of the resort, [Pizza Press](https://yelp.to/7WpJbN4sHfb) on Harbor and Disney way is the best. They are one of those build your own personal pizza places like Blaze, Mod, or Pieology, but a bit better if you ask me. They theme their pizzas as if it was an old newspaper press which is kind of neat, though they have dropped most of the theming in favor of efficiency since they moved a few blocks and started expanding franchises throughout orange county. Also they are usually open until 1am which makes it perfect for an end of the day trip. \n\nSource: I am a hardcore Disneyland fan, who had maintained an annual pass for over 20 years and used to average about 2 visits a week before the pandemic.
