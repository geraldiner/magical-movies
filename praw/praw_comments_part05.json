    "body": "True story. I watched some scenes of this movie when I was young, like maybe 7 or 8. Late July, school was out, and we had just moved into a new house. It was late at night, all the adults in my house were asleep. It was raining that night too so the smell and sound of the raindrops hitting the earth inundated my senses. Overall, it felt like a magical night.\n\nThe scenes burned into my memory was the one where The Lion gave himself up to be killed by The Witch in place of the boy, and the entire family cries with the Lion before he\u2019s led away to be sacrificed. This was followed by The Lion dying and then coming back towards the end of the movie in a beam of light. The Lion was all I saw that night.\n\nUnfortunately growing up in a developing country, our power was cut off halfway. I tried to see if it was on for some days after that, couldn\u2019t find it. I also checked the guide to see if I could find the name of a movie shown in the past few days that was similar in name. What I was explicitly looking for was \u2018Lion that talks\u2019 because the lion\u2019s kind, smiling face stuck out to me. Still couldn\u2019t find it.\n\nFast forward a few years, and whenever I felt unhappy, the lion\u2019s kind, smiling face would comfort me. I asked many of my neighbors if they had seen a movie with the same description above, and no one seemed to remember. At this time, I was around 11/12 years old, in boarding school, and my family was going through tough times. My dad had just been out of a job, my mom was unemployed for a few years, my mom\u2019s brother had just died- the household was in turmoil to say the least. Lots of arguments whenever I came home from school. Lots of screaming and shouting at me too. But I remembered the lion\u2019s kind, smiling face, and I felt peace.\n\nI was in school one night during this period, and my friends and I were telling stories right before bedtime. The prompt was phrased somewhat like this question, and obviously I spoke of the scene about the lion that seemed like it was part of a heavenly vision.\n\nMy friend looked at me, and said quite matter-of-factly, \u2018That sounds like the Chronicles of Narnia.\u2019",

    "body": "**Meet the Robinsons (2007).**\n\nI can't describe how much this movie means to me. It came out shortly after my family moved to a new country and city (Montr\u00e9al, Canada). I was 12 when it came out, and I had been in Canada for just under a year -- enough to make a couple of new friends, but not long enough to not be missing \"home\" a lot. I only spoke English and had lived in a hot country, in the middle of downtown in a huge city in Asia. Now, suddenly, I was in a mostly-French suburb of a freezing cold city that seemed totally alien. I was really into science and Doctor Who, and I didn't know how to turn that into meaningful friendships. I have autism (undiagnosed at the time), so the feelings of alienation were even worse because of that. \n\nSuddenly, this movie came along. It didn't fix everything, but the themes resonated with me so much. \"Keep moving forward\" -- that's exactly what I needed to hear. Lewis/Cornelius was a misfit kid, lost and alone, who got dropped into a new place where people were kind enough to help him move forward. I don't have the best relationship with my parents... but Lewis/Cornelius had *no* parents, and he was still okay. He still found people who were kind to him. Both Lewis/Cornelius and Goob (Bowler Hat Guy) were weird outcasts, who managed to find a home, and a life, where everything was gonna be okay... and, if they could, so could I. \n\nI know it wasn't super well-received compared to other Disney stuff.

To this day i get creeped out at the scene in the radio station with the water dripping down the 8 track deck and the creepy voice playing, and the plank showing \"6 must die\" before bursting into flames.\n\nAs many Carpenter movies it wasn't really a box office hit but found its following later.\n\nI watched the remake once and it didn't hit anything.

Lots of people say this wasn't a great movie, but I loved every frame of it. It's rare that a movie is pure art from start to finish, but this panoply of character examinations touches my very soul.\n\n**Saving Private Ryan.** Specifically the opening scene with the storming of the beach at Normandy. This may be the finest filmmaking that has ever been produced. The colorist influenced every subsequent war film, picture, and video game all the way up until  Jojo Rabbit decided bright color was okay again. The direction is spectacular. The acting superb. And then cinematography re-wrote how to do war, action, and cinema verite. The average length of shot during that sequence is 7 seconds. That's an incredibly long time for modern media. And yet it never feels stale. Instead, you're right there, in the moment, as confused and fearful and brave as the characters on the screen. I will watch this any time it's on, and re-watch it again afterwards. It's a shame that the rest of the film, while a good watch, doesn't live up to the undeniable brilliance of the opening sequence.\n\n**The Harry Potter Series**. What strikes me as most remarkable about this series is that the filmmaking matures right alongside the characters. The first film is almost campy in its special effects, and frankly amateurish at times in its direction. Though that may all have been the plan from the beginning. It is very much \"of an era\" and was produced right at the end of that style of filmmaking being the norm. Then you get to film two, and there's a noticeable shift towards what we'd consider modern filmmaking. And so it progresses. The final films are as modern as it comes, and it's hard to imagine that they were some of the first films ever produced in that style. The editing, direction, color, grit and grime on the lens during shots... it's all excellent. But you can't leave it at that because there are elements that permeate all of the films despite the changing styles and directors. Long, tracking transition shots that pass through solid objects (usually windows), for example, are a hallmark of the films. So while each individual film is fine, taken en masse they are magical.",

I have to mention the background music again because it's the best music I've heard in my entire life.

    "body": "HEAT (1995, directed by Michael Mann) \n\nIt's got every ingredient in it that makes a kick ass movie. You got Pacino and DeNiro stealing every single scene they're in and when they're in it together, they one up each other and walk away like total fucking badasses. And that's not to take away from Val Kilmer or Wes Studio or Tom Sizemore. They all get their scene stealing moments too and they're so well written imo. But the greatness doesn't stop there, oh no sir! You got depth to the supporting characters. They're not just expendable characters like you would normally come to expect in these types of movies. They have problems too and their problems affect the main characters problems and they bounce off each other in such superb storytelling and screenwriting that I feel like I'm getting to know them intimately on a deeper level. \n\nHey! We're not fucking finished here, sit the fuck down. Now you got the technicals. The cinematography, amazing. Love those colours, the framing, the lighting. It's like every frame is a painting. Then you got the editing, which I'd argue is where the movie is really made. It's so well edited that the pacing doesn't even  make it feel like a 3 hour movie. I feel so satisfied after I watch it, like after a decent meal, yet I still want seconds but I'm also ok with not getting seconds. Then you got the musical score, unreal. I see where Hans Zimmer got his inspiration from. Hell, I'd even go as far as saying that The Dark Knight wouldn't be possible without a movie like Heat being made. Just listen to the score in the dark knight and watch the heist sequence or any of what the supporting characters go through in the rest of the story. It's one big homage to Heat but with a comic book spin to it. I'm not saying that like it's a bad thing. TDK was fucking bonkers amazing. But Nolan clearly took a lot of notes from Heat, put his magic touch on it and made a dope ass superhero crime thriller in the process. \n\nGo watch Heat if you haven't already. You won't regret it.",

I found out when my uncle took me to see the Deathly Hallows Part 2 in the cinema (that's how long it took me to get into them) and from the very start of the film with the duel between Snape & Mcgonagal to the end of the film with the final battle between Harry & Voldemort I was completely blown away... I realised I had been missing out all this time.\n\nI went home, whipped my laptop out and watched The Philsopher's Stone online and it gripped me from start to finish. But it wasn't enough to satisfiy the cravings... I instantly got hooked and became a Harry Potter addict searching for my next fix so I looked for the next one straight away. After finishing The Chamber Of Secrets some 2 hours later I went through withdrawls itching for the next one... Just one more tonight I thought to myself with strained red eyes from staring at my laptop intensely for like 4 hours straight... Just one more, I loaded up the Prisoner Of Azkaban and watched until the film was over and the night had gone. I then overdosed on the rest of them the very next day, good times.\n\nTL:DR: Harry Potter is the shit",

    "body": " All three of my favorite films.\n\nThe Hudsucker Proxy. The cinematography, pacing, visual montages and soundtrack are all exceptional.
