  "body": "My brother, 'bout 20 years ago, went and got his wisdom teeth removed.  I was the designated driver, and -- knowing he was in a ton of pain, and cognisance was NOT in his corner -- was at his beck-and-call, waiting for the \"odd request\" to rear its' ugly head. \n I paraded him back home, and carefully placed him onto the couch.  During one brief lull (of semi-lucidity), he requested that I go and rent \"Buckaroo Bonzai (and those dimensions)\".  Knowing that this was NOT the sanest of calls, I put the movie on (somehow, we'd PURCHASED that particular movie on VHS), then jumped into my Plymouth Reliant ('87, VERY beat up bit still....honestly, kinda reliable) and headed into town to go to the rental store.\n\nBuckaroo would be too awkward and confusing, I'd imagine -- he hadn't seen it before, but had been lauded of stories (from me) about how I tried to make sense of it all -- and I have NO clue why that's the movie his addled-brain landed on.  But hey, I'm diligent and wanted to do him a solid during his \"time of need,\" so I went to the rental store and picked up.....\"Big Trouble in Little China\" instead.  (We had both seen it prior -- possibly during one of our \"USA *Up* All Night\" marathons, but it....it just felt like the right call.  Also, he didn't seem to remember it at all, so...why the hell not?)\n\nOn the way back home from \"Aardvark Video\" (yay, small-town rental stores), I stopped in at Kentucky Fried Chicken (since it was STILL CALLED THAT AT THE TIME) and bought a couple bowls of Mashed Potatoes, plus some Extra Tasty Crispy if he ever found himself able to eat it without storing pockets of fried protein/flour/GREASE in his open wounds.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, both bowls of pureed starches, and some VERY weird conversations (a fine combination of \"dreams\" ((?)) and \"that movie I just saw, but PUT IT ON AGAIN I KINDA LIKED IT\"), he was back to being....kinda normal.\n\nSo really, I think it was BTiLC that helped my brother get through some serious dental work that day. That, and The Colonel.  (Also, spoilers....I ate all the fried chicken.  It was only a wing/leg/thigh, and I was HUNGRY, you can't fault me for that...right...?)",
