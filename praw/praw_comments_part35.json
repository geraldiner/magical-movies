    "body": "Thanks for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate it and will think about what you said when I get around to my second watch. You are absolutely right about the love and care they took with every scene of the film. Everything from direction, acting, art/set/costume/etc. was top notch and it was visually stunning. Music and score too.\n\nI think the plot lines of DiCaprio's decline and Pitt's run in with the Manson family did not match up at all and the overall pacing was just off to me. It felt to me like a very incoherent mashup of a variety of Hollywood scenes and gags, which as I write this I realize might have been part of the whole point of the film?\n\nWhen I watch something like Django, I think of the how Tarantino plays with tension throughout the entire Candy Land sequence. Constantly building tension, then loosening its grip only to squeeze harder and harder over and over until you finally get that gun shot from Dr. Shultz finally releasing it all in one singular moment. None of that skill is shown off in Once Upon A Time at all because it is so disjointed to me. That is not to say that Once Upon A Time needed to have that same energy or emotion; it is a very different emotional space from any of Tarantino's other films imo. There just seemed to be a lack of any cohesion in the film from scene to scene or in any of the characters outside of DiCaprio and Pitt. Everything seemed confusing and just really off. \n\nI am sure I had a very emotional reaction to all of that when I first saw it. I had very high expectations of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and I hope that when I revisit it I can see it in a better light. Thanks again for sharing with me! Cheers!\n\nedit: left out a sentence, added it in.",

That is not to say that Once Upon A Time needed to have that same energy or emotion; it is a very different emotional space from any of Tarantino&#39;s other films imo. There just seemed to be a lack of any cohesion in the film from scene to scene or in any of the characters outside of DiCaprio and Pitt. Everything seemed confusing and just really off. </p>\n\n<p>I am sure I had a very emotional reaction to all of that when I first saw it. I had very high expectations of Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and I hope that when I revisit it I can see it in a better light. Thanks again for sharing with me! Cheers!</p>\n\n<p>edit: left out a sentence, added it in.</p>\n</div>",

I agree that the newest movies are overhated, but they are not better than the original three masterpieces</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "For me the original trilogy set Luke up as the idealistic youth who wholeheartedly believes in the power good over evil. Only once in the OT does he give in to his anger and hatred, but he realizes what\u2019s happening in the moment and pulls back before he kills Darth Vader. Then proceeds to profess his unwillingness to ever turn to the dark side to The Emperor himself, he does this as he believes his friends are dying and more importantly he does this in the face of certain death for himself. But still he is unwilling to turn, he still believes the light is stronger than the dark. He\u2019s willing to stand up to the ultimate evil in the galaxy because he is certain that good will ultimately triumph. So you\u2019re telling me this character suddenly has a change of heart and goes into hiding and believes The Jedi need to end just because one of his students falls to the dark side? I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t buy it, it\u2019s just too much of a departure from the character that was set up in the OT.",

So people would actually TALK about what a great movie it was.  \n\n\nThis is a lot of why we will never have another Star Wars.  There can't be.  It's too easy for copycats.  Every idea for a movie has been done at this point. And if there was, there would be a vocal minority trashing it online.  Whether it was deserved or not.  No movie today will ever have the impact or the chance to be a cultural touchstone that brings everyone together for a warm moment.  It just simply can't happen in the negative world we live in.  IMO, BTTF is the best movie ever made. But, hypothetically, if a better movie was ever made, it wouldn't get the praise it deserved.  \n\n\nOK, having said all that.  For me, personally, it was a \"Oh My God\" moment.  I was in that awkward teen time of life, having just come out my parent's divorce.   The movie spoke to me in a couple of ways.    \n\n\n1.  It made me feel good as a young adult to be care free.  I really related with Marty on how he should just not worry about life.  Deal with the problem you have, but just don't be negative and depressed. Watching it gives me a sliver of a feeling of what it's like to have a care-free non-adult life.\n\n2. As lame as it is, Doc was the reason I studied Physics in college.  Which, as people pointed out, wasn't the best career move at the time.  As it would turn out, it wouldn't matter and I did just fine.  But still.  It had a profound affect on how I would start my life as I was leaving high school.  \n\n\n3. I loved Huey Lewis and the News, independent of the movie, so that helped.  \n\n\n4. I'm at an age where I start to lose people in my life.  The whole concept of time travel sort of gives a (false) feeling that you can never really lose someone, as you simply go back and visit them.  Likewise, you can just go a visit that perfect time in your life, and get that feeling back.  \n\n\nAlso, as it's been said before.  It's meager special effects hold up.  The writing is top notch, and no line doesn't move the story forward.  The foreshadowing is smart, and not heavy handed.

Yes, what separates magical realism from metaphor, allegory, exaggeration, or rhetorical device, etc is that it is a fundamental component of the story.  The magic is Real and cannot be removed from the story.  But, conversely, the magic should not be seen as something that is separate from the reality in the story, or a separate \"world\" even if it presents itself as such.  The magic is there because, in a way it makes the real story MORE real, than if there had been no magic at all.  Similarly, the magic of the story does not really make sense (other than to say it is unexplainable!magic!) without understanding the reality around it. You could not really understand the hell that child went through, without seeing the mosters she encountered, both real and imagined.  Or the absolute pity of a small child imagining herself triumphing over imaginary evil made real, because she was powerless to act against the real evil that was killing the real people she loved, around her.\n\nI really recommend reading the short story I mentioned, light like water.

    "body": "What? I think you 1) have no idea what you\u2019re talking about and 2) obviously completely missed the pt of Jessica Rabbit in the movie. The complaint of women not wanting to be objectified is strengthened by the nature of how that character is drawn. And that\u2019s the whole pt of the character \u2014 she\u2019s treated a certain way, like so many women are everyday, and objectified and sexualized because of the way men view her; she\u2019s actually asexual in the movie, ie she doesn\u2019t want to be in treated the way she is but she\u2019s limited by the men view and treat women in the world she inhabits.\n\nThis belief that it\u2019s ok to sexualize women in every scenario, every facet of life because \u201cpeople love sex\u201d is so fucked up. What you really mean is men feel entitled to stare and objectify women because they\u2019ve told themselves it\u2019s natural and they should have everything they want regardless of whether women want to be treated that way or not. Why must women alway be \u201csexy\u201d in movies? I\u2019d say your example of \u201cLaura Croft\u201d is more an Indictment of the way in which women are devalued if they aren\u2019t deemed sexy enough for the male viewer. There are so many movies with male leads whose sexiness or lack thereof is completely immaterial. Why is that? Why can people still enjoy sex and still enjoy being attracted to other people and it have zero bearing on a movie with an unsexy male lead? Because men are not valued solely by how they look. There\u2019s no reason Laura Croft needs to be sexy. It\u2019s the culture you live in that tells you she wouldn\u2019t be worth remembering if she wasn\u2019t conventionally sexy to men. And that\u2019s fucked up and not true.",
    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>What? I think you 1) have no idea what you\u2019re talking about and 2) obviously completely missed the pt of Jessica Rabbit in the movie. The complaint of women not wanting to be objectified is strengthened by the nature of how that character is drawn. And that\u2019s the whole pt of the character \u2014 she\u2019s treated a certain way, like so many women are everyday, and objectified and sexualized because of the way men view her; she\u2019s actually asexual in the movie, ie she doesn\u2019t want to be in treated the way she is but she\u2019s limited by the men view and treat women in the world she inhabits.</p>\n\n<p>This belief that it\u2019s ok to sexualize women in every scenario, every facet of life because \u201cpeople love sex\u201d is so fucked up. What you really mean is men feel entitled to stare and objectify women because they\u2019ve told themselves it\u2019s natural and they should have everything they want regardless of whether women want to be treated that way or not. Why must women alway be \u201csexy\u201d in movies? I\u2019d say your example of \u201cLaura Croft\u201d is more an Indictment of the way in which women are devalued if they aren\u2019t deemed sexy enough for the male viewer. There are so many movies with male leads whose sexiness or lack thereof is completely immaterial. Why is that? Why can people still enjoy sex and still enjoy being attracted to other people and it have zero bearing on a movie with an unsexy male lead? Because men are not valued solely by how they look. There\u2019s no reason Laura Croft needs to be sexy. It\u2019s the culture you live in that tells you she wouldn\u2019t be worth remembering if she wasn\u2019t conventionally sexy to men. And that\u2019s fucked up and not true.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "Seems like I'm one of the few who likes *The World's End* more than *Shaun of the Dead*.\n\nThey're both great movies (*Hot Fuzz* is my favorite of the trilogy), but *TWE* just had a really great balance of humor and tragedy. As somebody who grew up in a nowhere town, Gary King is such a spot-on portrayal of that \"cool guy\" in high school who never moved on, and Simon Pegg does such a good job portraying his highs and lows. Nick Frost also did great with flipping the script, becoming the straight man to Pegg and slowly coming unhinged as the night goes on and the drinks are downed.\n\nI also just really appreciate how much effort went into the structure of the film, with both pub crawls echoing each other without becoming predictable. The fight scenes are also weirdly good, and give the movie this incredibly off-kilter and unpredictable energy. The gang fighting off those robots/blanks/blue bloods (\"look, nothing suggested in the last three minutes has been better than 'smashy smashy egg man'\") while Gary tries to get a drink had me rolling.\n\nI understand that the movie is different from its predecessors, and I can see how some folks might be put off by Gary (obnoxious prick that he can be) and the drastic tonal shifts. But the latter is my jam and the former... I just can't stay mad at him. Because I know that guy. I know that town.

    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Seems like I&#39;m one of the few who likes <em>The World&#39;s End</em> more than <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re both great movies (<em>Hot Fuzz</em> is my favorite of the trilogy), but <em>TWE</em> just had a really great balance of humor and tragedy. As somebody who grew up in a nowhere town, Gary King is such a spot-on portrayal of that &quot;cool guy&quot; in high school who never moved on, and Simon Pegg does such a good job portraying his highs and lows. Nick Frost also did great with flipping the script, becoming the straight man to Pegg and slowly coming unhinged as the night goes on and the drinks are downed.</p>\n\n<p>I also just really appreciate how much effort went into the structure of the film, with both pub crawls echoing each other without becoming predictable. The fight scenes are also weirdly good, and give the movie this incredibly off-kilter and unpredictable energy. The gang fighting off those robots/blanks/blue bloods (&quot;look, nothing suggested in the last three minutes has been better than &#39;smashy smashy egg man&#39;&quot;) while Gary tries to get a drink had me rolling.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the movie is different from its predecessors, and I can see how some folks might be put off by Gary (obnoxious prick that he can be) and the drastic tonal shifts. But the latter is my jam and the former... I just can&#39;t stay mad at him. Because I know that guy. I know that town. And as wrong-headed as he may be, sometimes I feel where he&#39;s coming from.</p>\n\n<p>Also it has Martin Freeman. I love Martin Freeman.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I know <em>Hot Fuzz</em> and <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> had Martin Freeman, too, but only for like two scenes. I could always do with a bit more.</p>\n</div>",

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any movie out there that has had better accompanying music.</p>\n</div>",

But I grew up watching Tremors, being legit scared to walk on the ground after watching it, so I'm not going to say they are bad because I don't think they are, but with bad sci fi you can have bad sci fi that is still fun to watch, and then you can have bad sci fi that is not only shitty, it's just hard to watch as a movie.  And I'll go pretty low, like when Arrival came out and people were asking me if I was going to see it, or if I had seen it (people who know me that know I love sci fi) I basically would always just respond with you mean THE Arrival, the 1996 with Charlie Sheen?  I love it.  Then I saw Arrival and as someone who also likes good sci fi, Arrival is actually pretty high up there for me in terms of great sci fi.  And no, not many people understood what I was talking about, even after explaining the movie, nobody seems to have seen The Arrival other than me.  \n\nBut anyways, I love bad sci fi, but I'm a biologist/chemist in real life, which straight up ruined a lot of sci fi for me, it's super unfortunate, but it makes me SUPER glad I didn't go into physics, because while I have a decent grasp of basic physics, including some theoretical and astro physics, I don't *really* know enough that I'm super bound to the laws of physics in the same way that physicists tend to be.  Like, I'm a lot more lenient for lazy physics than lazy biology.  But, despite being a biologist it's like, the easiest and most accessible of all the STEM fields to understand.  And yes, I still love Jurassic Park, they handled the biology well that despite it being basically impossible, they didn't really break any rules when it came to the current science, and actually depicted how it *Could* work pretty well.  while I haven't been a super fan of the new ones, I was very glad that they retconned some of it, basically saying \"monsters, we just created genetic monsters\" because that seems more plausible than what they advertised they had done in the first one, it also explains advances in paleontology.  \n\nLike the Movie Outbreak, if you have seen it, it's about an ebola epidemic in a small town and the US government's response.  It's a good movie, you should watch it, and it's fairly accurate in a lot of ways, except I don't think a 'simple' mutation to the physiology of ebola is going to make it any more aeresolizable than it already is, which is not really at all, I mean, if someone infected coughs a bunch of blood on you then yeah, but how they depict aeresolized microbes boarders on reality, but breaks with reality when dealing with ebola, it's just not the same kind of virus that aerosolizes.  But I digress, and I look past it, because it has Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Cuba Gooding Jr. in it and it's close enough to reality that even though I get pulled out of the movie at certain points for inaccuracy, I'm able to get back into it.",

That&#39;s it.  Anything else is pure bullshit.  I&#39;m not proud of it, I&#39;m not bragging about how many times I&#39;ve sailed the seas, I don&#39;t pretend like it&#39;s a good thing.  It&#39;s just a thing I&#39;ve done for my own selfish reasons.</p>\n</div>",

The government agencies are referred to as organs, implying the government is one holistic body. The nuclear war between American President Ted Kennedy and the Soviet Union led to massive famine and winter, which caused the people of the UK to elect Norsefire in an authentic democratic process. And it can be said that this fictional government truly was attempting to serve the people of the UK with its utter fascism.  The leader, Sutler, was not particularly depicted as evil, dangerous, or the antagonist. He had a desire to help his country and a pathetic devotion to an unloving artificial intelligence. (This is referencing the efforts of authoritarian governments in the 20th century efforts to justify their actions via \u201cscientific\u201d rationalities). Ultimately a simple and pathetic character. \n\nThis is not to say this version of Norsefire is a good thing. The resultant government cares absolutely nill about an individual, is racist, strives to eliminate minorities. They set up secret death camps and their apathy/mismanagement of the lower classes causes mass unemployment and fosters a violent and dangerous underworld. \n\nThe later third of the story is filled with pro government characters and showing them as essentially good people. Of how a good person who just \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d or is slightly self serving can fall into the trap of working with fascism. \n\nI won\u2019t go into as much detail but the original character of V is an avatar of anarchy, particularly the destructive side of it. V\u2019s singular mission is to take the path of destruction in order to dismantle the body of Norsefire. V celebrates individual liberty and an inclusive culture of expression. However, murder, torture, and mass killing of bystanders are all morally acceptable  and done for V\u2019s destruction. \n\nMoore\u2019s intent was to not make it a melodramatic morality tales of an underdog defeating the evil empire.  These two extremes are presented to the reader so that the reader can identify where their own political beliefs might lie and then maybe apply to to where the state of government was going. \n\nIt is in this way that the reader is almost forced to be empowered by their interrogation of events and moral standing.  The tale is very, very much about late 70\u2019s/early 80\u2019s UK political culture and the rise of Margaret Thatcher. \n\nThe film version of Norsefire is oppressive and authoritarian. It is evil is that it created it own rise to power.  All grey morality is removed. Norsefire is darkly evil, V is shining light. The words fascism and anarchy are actively removed from the film. The filmmakers did not want to make the conflict between extream forms of polar opposite governments. They want to make the conflict more grounded in current (for 2005) American politics. \n\nI understand why they were motivated to do this. But unfortunately the original story is thematically inseparable from some of the ideas they cut away. \n\nEvee\u2019s character arc in the original is to rise from the character with the least agency to the one with the most via her becoming a new V, this version dedicated to the creative side anarchy.

That magic is as real as anything else, a house, math, an object, etc. It has properties.  It can be used, directed, understood.  It can be a character.\n\nPans Labryinth is written, so that if that is your expectation for what the magic is in the movie, then you can absolutely enjoy the movie with that expectation.  But that isn't, actually, what the magic is in Pans Labryinth.  And understanding this difference, is what makes Pans Labryinth such a deep piece of art.\n\nIn Pans Labryinth, magic is as real as a hammer, or rock, or house to the main character.  But the magic itself, is not.  Authors of Magical Realist works are not creating magical \"things\" or magical frameworks or magical characters. They are using magic as a way of expressing the reality of the situation, for that character, in a more vivid and impactful and human and emotional way than can be done with just real text.\n\nLet's try a simpler example?  Imagine a story where a woman is raped.  Now imagine that when she tells the story, she describes how he has long wild hair, and seemed extremely dangerous when they first met.  And she describes how on her way home, she felt like she was being followed.  <-- This would be realist literature.\n\nNow imagine that same story, but instead, when the woman tells it, she says that he looked \"like a wolf\" because of his long hair.  And he attacked her like she was prey.  <-- These are just metaphors and similies, but they express how she was feeling much better.\n\nNow imagine the same story, as a movie, where we learn that in this world, there are werewolves. Werewolves are people that can turn into wolves.  As she's walking home, the man turns into a wolf.  <-- This is Harry Potter.  Depending on the author, this can be easier or more impactful than the previous similes and metaphors.  It is left to the abilities of the author, and the abilities of the reader, to understand that this is a metaphor taken a step further.  But it kinda looses some of its emotional potency, because \"werewolves are just a thing in this world.\"  and there will inevitably be many other examples of things \"werewolves\" do in the story.  \n\nNow lastly, imagine the story as the woman is in a bar, and is met by a charming prince.  When he walks in, roses fall from the sky, and the air turns sweet.  Her drink tastes fabulous, but storm clouds gather overhead.  As she sits at the bar, she turns into a sandwich, and realizes the man she is talking to is emaciated, consumed by hunger, and she is unable to move to free herself.  In the next paragraph, she is running along the streets to get home, but now the sky is black, the wind is howling, and she can see the wolf darting impossibly from shadow to shadow, bush to bush behind her.  Her scream runs from the house, down the street, in through the keyhole of the front door, and forcibly shakes the neighbor awake.  The neighbor immediately calls the police, but it is too late.\n\nThat's magical realism.  Yes, magic is real in this last example too.  But its not real because she encountered a wolf.  Its real, because its about a rape.  To just read that story, and think its about a woman running from a wolf, as if it as a Harry Potter story, misunderstands the point of the magic.\n\nPans Labryinth is pretty incredible, because they made a Magical Realist movie, that was toned down enough that you could watch it like a Harry Potter movie, and it still works.  But that's not all that's going on there.",

Those movies really don\u2018t have interesting lightsaber battles.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "Sorry, I know this is off topic from val Kilmer :)\n\nBut Yea I mean that\u2019s really obvious now I think about it. So many religions are basically just cults. Including Christianity. I know Christianity is obviously not the level of psycho it was back in say medieval times - but even back then, the real difference from today, is that they took the interpretation of the scripture and belief system so much more seriously than many do now. If a woman had an extramarital affair, supposedly, witness or proof or not, all it took was the accusation of a husband or townsperson and she was brought to the town square, put up on a platform where (of course, like wtf) everyone in the town came as a mob, and her nose and Tits were cut off. You\u2019re supposed to be stoned as a Christian man if you don\u2019t grow a full length beard or if you where anything but a long dress thing or if you wore any fabric that was made up of more than one material. So 100% wool or your stoned to death. \n\nChristians and their bullshit against the Jews - when Jesus was a Jew.  (I don\u2019t know a lot about the Jewish beliefs but what I do know really made me love it - without knowing a lot. I recall reading about how they believe if you don\u2019t fulfill your purpose during your life time you return as an animal or something, it was long ago I heard that, I don\u2019t remember, but I found it very touching (I guess it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t remember what people say or do, but how it made you feel), I don\u2019t believe in the inhuman treatment of animals or of slaughtering them for meat, but if people are going to do it, it\u2019s my understanding that kosher requires the animal be treated humanely.\n\nIf you consider the way a woman was maimed for the accusation of cheating alone, and the fact that the so called Virgin Mary was a teenage girl who got pregnant when she was supposed to be a virgin, like ....you guys know any teenage girls? If we lived during a time where a teen girl got knocked up and could say \u201cI am a virgin, god came and...ghost banged me! So like don\u2019t cut my tits off, btw that means this baby is son of god so like don\u2019t f with him\u201d. What teenage girl wouldn\u2019t use that to help herself. But either way, you were Christian or you were a witch or satanic or unholy and blasphemous. Our beliefs or else. And don\u2019t associate with anyone who isn\u2019t like us.\n\nMeanwhile....over in Hollywood, the Scientology people call anyone in ur life who even questions your beliefs an \u201cSP\u201d for suppressive person. And you\u2019re not allowed to have contact with them. That\u2019s why so many stay in too, because if you and your husband and kids are all in the church and you and husband want to leave but the kids want to stay, they are forbidden from having contact with the church abandoners. Pretty sure the only one who has been able to work around this rule is Tom cruise. Nicole Kidman wanted out and took her kids with her, but they let Tom cruise still be around them, same with Katie Holmes and Suri cruise.\n\nIt\u2019s just all so fucking bizarre to me. And its really scary to me how many people are a part of one of these groups or another. Believe what you need to to be happy, but the cult mentality and the mob that goes along with it is scary as shit to me. \n\n(I do think a lot of the celebs in Scientology don\u2019t actually believe any of that nonsense. They just have so many connections in Hollywood, which enables them to lure desperate actors in with promises of introductions and acting jobs Ruth huge celebrities. For example, anyone who has watch handmaids tale, it\u2019s absolutely insane to believe that Elisabeth moss is playing that main role about what is basically a cult that takes over America and forces people to do horrible things and won\u2019t let anyone escape and kills anyone who doesn\u2019t follow their unclear scripture \u2014 unclear because they knock down Catholic Churches like st Patrick\u2019s cathedral in nyc, but are god and prayer this and scripture that... it\u2019s not explained what religion they are in the show \u2014 but like, that is a role that elisabeth moss dominates and is all about her escaping and fighting back and how fucked the cult of it all is......and she is a smart woman, but yet she\u2019s a Scientologist. \n\nIt\u2019s bizarre. And only makes sense to me in that she joined that church and then suddenly landed mad men and went from totally unheard of to one of the biggest stars on the planet. She\u2019s also not your classic white girl Hollywood beauty - I didn\u2019t find her particularly pleasing looking when she came on the scene. But I think she\u2019s absolutely lovely and so beautiful now, especially when she has on no makeup. She\u2019s just grown on me so much. Especially aesthetically. And also SO much more so when I see her being herself in interviews - she just lights up the room.\n\nBut it\u2019s unusual for a woman with unconventional looks to get a role like peggy, the sexy secretary on A big show like Mad Men or June on Handmaids Tale, the handmaid every dude wants a go at...I just think Scientology uses their Hollywood connections to lure actors and more and more follow.",

    "body": "Your point is that magical realism blurs the lines between fantasy and reality and that the magic serves a purpose larger than its face value.  That the magic in Pan's lab serves a purpose beyond just having magic in it.  It serves as an escape for Ophelia (is that her name?), and it's blurred so far that you can actually interpret it as her imagination and that the magic isn't even real at all.\n\nExcept you made the blatant claim that the magic *isn't real*.  You wrote: \"All of the magical parts of that movie are intended to explain what is going on in the real world. There is not really magical world in the movie\".  You also suggested some monsters were inagined.  Which is what I was clarifying, because the magic actually is real.  Not just a construct or a metaphor.  Magical realism really has real magic, just like this film, which is of course a perfect example of the genre.  It's not a story that incorporates magic in order to paint a fanciful reenactment of a real situation that obviously does not have magic.  It's a fantastical yet realistic film that portrays a world where magic very much does exist.",

I have some flicks I appreciate in this way, but The Room isn't one of them.   I'm happy some find joy in it.   When it comes to star wars there's something to love in all of them.   For instance I know people hate the space witch Leia flying back to the ship in TLJ.  I was just amped to see Leia use the force.   Personally I rank them (using episode numbers)  6,7,4,R1,5,8,3,solo,9,1,2. I know everyone is different.   If you want to like shit, cool.  If hating something brings you joy,  I guess good for you but that's not a philosophy I subscribe to.  \n\nI'm also happy that you enjoy the stuff you enjoy.  I hope you enjoy every film you watch from here to eternity.  Cheers friend",

Good or bad the remake doesn't affect the quality of the original.   \n\nAs far as the prequels go, are they perfect?  Hell no.  Are they good? Eh depends on what day I watch them.   However they did provide me with substance to make Vader my second favorite character in movie history (just slightly behind Tony Stark...judge me if you will but as you can tell it won't affect me lol).  He's tragic, and conflicted.  Who can't identify with that?   \n\nAlso thanks for being the only pleasurable response to my original comment.",
