I had seen the trailers, and thought it was going to be a Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy adventure.</p>\n\n<p>Let me tell you, watching Pan&#39;s Labyrinth for the first time while running a high fever is quite the trip. I was convinced I was hallucinating at parts. Still remains one of the my favorite movies, especially now that I&#39;m older and can appreciate the metaphors/history behind the plot.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been learning Spanish for the past couple of years, and it&#39;s a great movie to watch once in a while and see how I&#39;m improving.</p>\n</div>",

The movie's use of showtunes along with animation and adult themes created the blueprint Howard Ashman used to create the Disney Renaissance movies. It is widely responsible for modern children's animation being what it is, and for how music is presented in it. Several cartoons can directly tie their origins to WFRR, like Animaniacs, Freakazoid, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Bonkers. Cartoon Network happened directly because of this movie. \n\nIts also almost single-handedly responsible for revitalizing the public interest in feature length animation. After Disney had their Golden Age of feature length movies like Snow White, Cinderella, Dumbo, Pinocchio, and Alice in Wonderland, the studio nearly got bought out. After Walt and Roy O Disney died the studio was basically on fire, which led to a few legendarily bad performances at the box office, most notably the thermonuclear bomb that was The Black Cauldron. At this point Micheal Eisner becomes CEO of Disney, and has almost no faith in the animation department, but was convinced to allow them to make a few more feature films, like the Great Mouse Detective and Oliver and Company. Both of which not only did well, but competed again Don Bluth's An American Tale, The Land Before Time, and All Dogs go to Heaven. So to compete with Bluth Eisner team up with Steven Speilburg to create WFRR, and it is so successful in large part because of its use of show tunes, which were reminiscent of the Golden Age of musical theater that was also happening during the Golden Age of animation. Productions like Oklahoma, South Pacific, The King and I, and the Sound of Music that were created by the legendary Rogers and Hammerstein. There's literally a scene in WFRR where Jessica Rabbit sings \"Why Dont You Do Right\" from Stage Door Canteen, which came out in 1936. Snow White only came out a year later. \n\nThe channel Sideways on YouTube goes into much larger depth than i could here but I highly suggest giving it a watch. The video is called [What Makes Disney Music Sound Nostalgic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX0gZY9VKlM)",

Every single part of the movie builds up to it and nothing is wasted.  Basically every single *line* in the script moves you toward the final scene which is up there as one of my favorite scenes ever.\n\nAs to why (spoilers):\n>!He finally uses his arm tatoos which have been sublty flashed the whole movie.  Tilda in her Gabriel angel outfit. John realizing that he can fix this by summoning the Devil.  He knows he can summon the Devil because all the work he's put in to try to get into heaven AND that is mentioned several times leading up to this so the audience could potentially guess an alternative to asking for God's help.  Peter Stormare as Lou is absolutely perfect.  The best thing though, is that he makes a Deal with the Devil *and comes out on top!* He *sacrifices* himself, which is also set up earlier btw, and *makes it into Heaven because of it!*  He doesn't just make a Deal with the Devil and win, he fuckin' OWNS the Devil, who in his rage, *also saves John's life.* So in a crazy way, all the work he put in to try to buy his way into heaven works.!<\n\nIt really is an absolute masterpiece.\n\nEdit: Also, >!Shia getting killed right after he commits one of the seven deadly sins (pride).
