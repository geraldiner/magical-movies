I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever since seen a movie with such a unique visual style that really feels like a fairy tale, not just a fantasy story. </p>\n\n<p>There is no background given for Lilly and Jack, and how civilization really works in this world, just a bunch of weird characters roaming around. But it works. The constant glitter is outstanding, the dialogue and sets are great, the swamp witch scared the shit out of me as a kid, and Darkness is one of the best villains ever, portrayed perfectly by Tim Curry.</p>\n</div>",
