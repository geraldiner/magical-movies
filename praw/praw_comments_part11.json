I honestly do find it as a charming film with an incredible soundtrack and a great story filled with important life lessons like be yourself no matter what others think, never forget where you came from, and no amount of money and success will ever make you better than anybody else, but if you use it wrong it can definitely make you worse. It made me remember the sense of wonder and amazement a good movie can make us feel and always reminds me whenever I forget why I started wanting to be a writer in the first place.\nAnd to this day over 3 years later I still scream From Now On at the top of my lungs whenever it comes on.",

    "body": "\n\nCatch Me if You Can - absolutely phenomenal performances by Dicaprio and Hanks. Such an interesting story and directed so well by Spielberg with a amazing score from John Williams. I will never not love this movie. \n\nThe Departed - Absolutely stacked cast with a super interesting and well written story with super well written characters to back it up. Practically on the edge of my seat the entire movie and the setting of Boston pulls it all together. \n\nHarry Potter - not the best movies, but they're so nostalgic for me and I'm sure for many others around my age, and they do a great job of world building. The movies just feel so magical and everywhere in the movie feels real so its always fun to go back and be immersed in them every time. \n\nLord of the Rings - everything said for Harry Potter can be said for these as well, except these are actually super well directed and written movies imo. The chemistry between all the cast members is something I almost never see in any movie and it makes the characters and world that much more believable. It's crazy to me how well Jackson managed to make such a fantastical world become so believable on films. So many aspects contribute to it. The excellent writing, acting, chemistry, costume design, prop design, practical and special effects, music. Oh man, I could go on and on about this trilogy, I live and breathe these movies, I just have yet to see such a believable and immersive world on film as this, it's the only movie that consistently pulls me out of reality and into another world that I can only describe as a glimpse into another world.",
