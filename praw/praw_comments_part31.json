  "body": "I saw and felt the love put into it as I watched it. I\u2019m not sure why you (and so many others) disliked it so much. Everything from the score to the camerawork (especially the cast, I love all three leads) just made me feel all good and warm inside. The opening scene is a great edition to the movie and gives us a look at the relationship Rick and Cliff have. The opening credits scene is my favorite of all time. Watching Rick work on that TV show with Jim Stacey was suuuper entertaining (I felt like I was in another movie until Rick asked for his line). Watching Sharon Tate go about her day was so nice, especially the scene where she goes to watch her own movie (it\u2019s a touching tribute). Cliff\u2019s flash back to stunting for the Green Hornet was entertaining and I liked seeing him and Bruce Lee fight a lil bit. Cliff\u2019s storyline with Pussycat is great too (\u201cwant me to suck your cock while driving?\u201d made me choke on my drink). The Spahn Ranch scenes gave was in contrast to the rest of the movie, super tense. The Out of Time sequence is Tarantino at his finest (it literally tells you that now we\u2019re \u201cout of time\u201d and in a new sort of alternate history, as everything up until that point had mostly been pretty accurate to real history). Of course the home invasion scene is brilliant, I mean it\u2019s Tarantino violence so what\u2019s to complain about? Plus seeing members of the Manson Family get fucked up was awesome. Rick getting his flamethrower out of the toolshed was a nice throwback to the beginning of the movie and absolutely hilarious, however cartoonish it might feel (it totally makes sense when you think about it tho). The ending was magical and fantastical and had a song to back it up.\n\nAll that being said I could probably guess why some people don\u2019t like it: it\u2019s got a pretty of slow build up (but I don\u2019t mind it), there wasn\u2019t a lot of \u201caction\u201d in this one compared to other Tarantino films (but I don\u2019t mind that either), some people think Margot Robbie wasn\u2019t given enough screen time (although I disagree, I think she had just the right amount of screen time), or maybe you just didn\u2019t enjoy it (which is totally fine).\n\nEdit: jeez, I didn\u2019t mean to write that much lol\n\nEdit 2: Taking everything I just said into mind, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his best movie ever, it\u2019s just my favorite one. Django: Unchained and Pulp Fiction are 100% his two best made and directed (I lean more towards Django because of the score and some specific scenes that are genius).",

Cliff\u2019s storyline with Pussycat is great too (\u201cwant me to suck your cock while driving?\u201d made me choke on my drink). The Spahn Ranch scenes gave was in contrast to the rest of the movie, super tense. The Out of Time sequence is Tarantino at his finest (it literally tells you that now we\u2019re \u201cout of time\u201d and in a new sort of alternate history, as everything up until that point had mostly been pretty accurate to real history). Of course the home invasion scene is brilliant, I mean it\u2019s Tarantino violence so what\u2019s to complain about? Plus seeing members of the Manson Family get fucked up was awesome. Rick getting his flamethrower out of the toolshed was a nice throwback to the beginning of the movie and absolutely hilarious, however cartoonish it might feel (it totally makes sense when you think about it tho). The ending was magical and fantastical and had a song to back it up.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said I could probably guess why some people don\u2019t like it: it\u2019s got a pretty of slow build up (but I don\u2019t mind it), there wasn\u2019t a lot of \u201caction\u201d in this one compared to other Tarantino films (but I don\u2019t mind that either), some people think Margot Robbie wasn\u2019t given enough screen time (although I disagree, I think she had just the right amount of screen time), or maybe you just didn\u2019t enjoy it (which is totally fine).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: jeez, I didn\u2019t mean to write that much lol</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Taking everything I just said into mind, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his best movie ever, it\u2019s just my favorite one. Django: Unchained and Pulp Fiction are 100% his two best made and directed (I lean more towards Django because of the score and some specific scenes that are genius).</p>\n</div>",
