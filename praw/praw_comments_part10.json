Tombstone. It's like a Shakespearean tragedy. The fiery and passionate forbidden love of Wyatt and Josephine is at its core.

The underhanded maiming of Virgil and cowardly murder of Morgan by the Cowboys. The savage revenge Wyatt exacts upon the Cowboys. The recognition by Wyatt he can not defeat Ringo in a straight up gunfight yet still he soldiers on to meet his fate.\n\nAnd this brief description doesn't even mention the comic relief Doc provides throughout (\"if we weren't friends I just don't think I can bear it\", \"Frederick Fucking Chopin\",  \"I have two guns, one for each of you\", \"I know, let's have a spelling contest\"). The opium addiction of Mattie, the senseless slaughter of a priest, Marshall White, Mr. Fabian, McMasters, etc. The thinly veiled homophobia suffered by Billy (Sistah Boy). Even the duplicitous nature of the Mayor, who pretty much orchestrated the seminal gunfight, was somewhat glossed over.\n\nSure, I could be overstating the importance of several of these moments/scenes since it is one of my favorite movies. But I firmly stand by my assessment. I think the film is criminally underappreciated.\n\nOne more item of particular note is the fact that George Cosmatos did not serve as director of the movie for roughly 90% of the scenes. That job fell to Kurt Russell and I believe he did outstanding work. A prerequesite for Cosmatos lending his name to the film as director (to give it some gravitas and to appease the producers) was that this information could not be shared until after his death. Russell kept his word and most people still aren't aware he directed most of the movie.\n\nSorry ... one more tidbit.

From the very first time I saw him in The Executioner's Song, through to Coal Miner's Daughter, to Space Cowboys to Men In Black to No Country Fot Old Men to Captain America: The First Avenger he has basically played Tommy Lee Jones. Twice I have seen him attempt to show off his acting prowess. In Blown Away his awful Irish accent was totally distracting. And in Batman Forever ... let's just forget about that flick. I mean in Men In Black 3 I think he was the second best Tommy Lee Jones! Josh Brolin was spot on in that role.\n\nTo be fair I think Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to win that year for What's Eating Gilbert Grape, barely edging out Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List. Several actors Leo met that night were legitimately shocked to discover he was not actually mentally challenged. Quite a compliment. But neither embodied their role quite like Kilmer.
