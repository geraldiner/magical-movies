I spent a good chunk of today setting up the actual web application with REACT! ðŸ¤¯

What a trip that was. Shout out to Google and StackOverflow.

I also have been following at lot of [John Ahn's content on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFyXA9x8lpL3EYWeYhj4C4Q).

Since the videos I've been following are a couple years old, he uses older frameworks, such as `body-parser` and `jsonwebtoken`. Since I've learned how to use `passport-local` with Learn With Leon, that's what I've used for authentication.

But what's different this time is instead of redirecting on the server-side, we send the response codes (200: success, 404: not found, 500: internal server error, etc.) to the client-side, which React handles to generate the view or UI.
