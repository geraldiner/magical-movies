I spent a good chunk of today setting up the actual web application with REACT! ðŸ¤¯

What a trip that was. Shout out to Google and StackOverflow.

I also have been following at lot of [John Ahn's content on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFyXA9x8lpL3EYWeYhj4C4Q).

Since the videos I've been following are a couple years old, he uses other frameworks, such as `body-parser` and `jsonwebtoken`. Since I've learned how to use `passport-local` with Learn With Leon, that's what I've used for authentication.

So far, I have the client-side Sign Up page up and people can fill it out to create a new account.

And if I look in MongoDB, I can see the new account created in the users collection.

Something I've noticed now though is that the redirect after signing up goes back to `localhost:8888`. I'm not sure if this is the behavior I'm looking for. My first thought is that it should stay on `localhost:3000` because that's where the client side lives. I'll have to investigate further tomorrow.
