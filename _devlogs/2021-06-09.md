WE DID IT!

I had spent a couple days trying to clean up or process the data more, but I didn't know enough about NLTK or SpaCy to get anywhere good.

There are still issues with duplicate comments and subtle changes in title (eg. The Dark Crystal vs Dark Crystal).

So I just went with what I had, just to have template data. Since I'm learning TailwindCSS and React concurrently, it's a big step for me to get it all working like this.

Next, I'll have to figure out how to include the rank, but since the `Movies` component is utilizing `.map()`, it should be able to accept the index....I think.
