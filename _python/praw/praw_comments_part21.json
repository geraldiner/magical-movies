There's a fantastic use of color in this film, and has some of the best framed shots out there (Frollo on the steps of Notre Dame, Esmeralda looking at the stained glass, any shot with Quasimodo above the city).  The soundtrack never fails to give me shivers.  The Almost every single song has amazing tonal and key shifts - often bouncing from a major key and uplifting tone, to plummeting into darkness and dripping with animosity, or starting shy and apprehensive and swelling into triumph.  Mixing in actual hymns and Latin lyrics into the soundtrack was **chef's kiss**.\n\nBut you can't talk about Hunchback of Notre Dame without talking about Frollo.\n\nHe honestly leaves all other Disney villains in the dust imo - You've got Ursula, she wants to usurp the throne.  You've got Gaston, he just wants the girl.  You've got Jafar, who wants to usurp the throne.  You've got Scar, who wants to... usurp the throne (overused? Naaa).  You've got **literally Satan**.  Then there's Frollo, who is quite literally a genocidal maniac.  Frollo is such an abominable being.  He is *so sure* what he is doing is right and just, that he is ordained by his god, and he is *so wrong*.  He's terrifying.\n\nSorry for going off, I just really like this movie.",

    "body": "Honestly, Frollo is one of my favorite Disney villains out there. His villain song, Hellfire, is *really* well written. At first, he prays to be freed of his desires. He may be a dick but he's not a genuinely bad guy, he doesn't want to feel attraction to Esmeralda, etc. The viewer may even feel bad for him. And then as the song progresses, he starts to show his true colours: he *is* a bad guy, wickedly so. He starts to blame God, the devil, anyone but himself. It's not *his* fault, it's because God made him that way, or because the devil tempted him, etc. \n\nAnd at the end of the song, the viewer sees he's completely beyond saving. He screams to let Esmeralda burn in hellfire if she doesn't want to be with him, and the whole transition is honestly just really well executed. Great writing, in my opinion. Frollo isn't the most powerful, charismatic or badass Disney villain but his whole motivation and concept are really well written and executed. And he has the single best villain song in my opinion, too^(though \"Be prepared\" and \"Friends on the other side\" are also contenders for that title)",
