His argument is that Jedi are the sole cause of evil in the Galaxy, and so his logic is to end the Jedi so that evil may never come back. His method might be new and different, but at its core, it\u2019s the same pathos of the young farmer boy from the original trilogy (not to forget that he\u2019s just as stubborn).\n\nOn another note that\u2019s a bit more meta (TLJ in its entirety is pretty meta) is that I don\u2019t think Luke necessarily represents heroism in the Star Wars universe. I have always interpreted his character as the most human, just like Han is the conflicted antihero and Leia is the sassy leader. In the original trilogy he\u2019s impulsive, stubborn and even quite annoying sometimes because he represents the general audience. He\u2019s supposed to remind us of our adolescent self. \n\nAnd so, making him a disillusioned old man makes sense to me because that\u2019s the most human and honest reaction to what happened to him; and more importantly, it\u2019s a good way to keep him relevant to those that grew up admiring the character and feel as disillusioned with their lives (but granted, I agree that that\u2019s a very subjective point of view and I understand why not anyone loves it).",

  "body": "Personally, I think both scores are good.  I grew up with the Tangerine Dream score, and I can absolutely understand how doing so can automatically take points away from anything that makes the experience different.  And a traditionally orchestrated score, compared to floaty synthesized ambience, absolutely does change the feel of the movie.  My sister also grew up with the TG score and she cannot stand the European version of the movie.  Not even with the extra scenes.  I know her well enough to understand that she's taking offense at the different score and using it as an excuse to hate the entire idea of an additional version of the movie.\n\nBut as a composer myself, I find it pretty easy to avoid conflating the music with the movie.  And I understand where Goldsmith was coming from when he said _Legend_ is his personal favorite work.  The movie itself, obviously, gives a composer about as open a landscape as it is possible for a movie to do.  And Goldsmith rolls with it.  There's a particular sequence that may in fact be the best thing he ever composed.  It's the part leading up to Lily meeting the unicorns.  [Start listening here.](https://youtu.be/O6Cr7pqi8KM?t=307)  The music gives pretty obvious cues when it's shifting focus between the unicorns and the goblins.  (And here we have more evidence of traditional composers in the 80s tinkering with synths a bit.  Goldsmith in particular seemed to get a fair bit of use out of them.)  The music here is stunning.  But it's at 6:47 when Goldsmith outdoes himself.  That's when Lily breaks Jack's trust and heads out of cover to unknowingly risk everything.  The music underscores the urgency and hazard of this moment _poignantly._  It sounds like something from one of the greats of the early 20th century, like a sequence from Stravinsky's _Firebird._\n\nAbsolutely no offense to what (the then) Tangerine Dream accomplished with this movie\u2014in fact I happen to consider TG's version of this sequence to be a personal favorite, when the deliberately bizarre percussion kicks in\u2014but you can't touch that with 80s synths and a rather clich\u00e9d digital shakuhachi.",

Wang was the hero.  \n  \nI've always disagreed with this interpretation(even if it's official) for three reasons:  \n  \nFirstly, Jack hits all the classic hero story beats e.g. he's clearly the protagonist of the film, has a unique ability, kills the main boss etc.  \nSecondly, he acts heroic and risks his life to save others a number of times, even if it doesn't work out. e.g. trying to intervene in the kidnapping at the airport and 'Hide. They only saw me.' Even when he faces Lo-Pan about to throw the knife he movies Gracie behind him to protect her.  \nThirdly, it's Jack rather than Wang who takes charge at several points in the movie and comes up with the plans(which normally don't work out) that the others follow. They even highlight the pecking order with the gun swapping scene.  \n  \nI always thought Jack was a Western action hero who'd stumbled into an Eastern action movie and all the usual Western action tropes didn't work for him except for the one special ability it established at the beginning worked across genres.",
