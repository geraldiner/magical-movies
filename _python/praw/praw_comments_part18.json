This movie is about radioactive scorpions on a plane. \n\nYou may be shocked by this, but it's not a good movie. But it's also so laughably bad that it holds a place in my heart.\n\nUsually you can watch a bad movie and even if aspects of it don't work you can kind of get what they were going for, you just see where they weren't able to execute the idea correctly. Tail Sting doesn't have that. I legit can't tell if they're trying to be serious or not and I'm pretty sure there's a visible boom mic in one scene. They either just didn't care or didn't notice. \n\nSomething about the movie trying to play itself with a straight face despite being absolutely nothing about it working is charming to me. I enjoy that much more than films that try to be cheesey-funny on purpose (like Black Sheep).",

I was also going through a bad time in my life when it released. So, I had a copy of Inception on my iPhone at the time. And I just sat in my bed and watched Inception <strong><em>every</em></strong> night. I got up for work, came home, played games on my phone and then finished the night with Inception until I fell asleep. I must of have watched that movie hundreds of times because sometimes I&#39;d watch the movie twice a night.</p>\n\n<p>Even after all that, I still love watching that movie. It&#39;s not something I get tired of. I could easily watch it a few hundreds times more.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr Inception. It rocked my world and kept me company when I was learning to be an adult.</p>\n</div>",

So I was having a bad week when I went to the TV and turned it on, nothing that I liked was on, not American Dragon, not Johnny Test and not even Wonder Pets; you could say that my mood was drastically falling, I was almost in tears from just how tiring and frustrating that week had been when I went back to Nickelodeon only for it to start playing a movie, I was curious and just plain tired so I decided to watch it, and I loved it. \n\nI loved Leonardo\u2019s character and his \u2018Ghost of the Jungle\u2019 alter ego, the story behind it, Raph\u2019s alter ego, the monsters, that twist where Leo is captured, Splinter\u2019s reaction to what happened when he turns on the TV, the animation, the background music, their personalities, I just loved everything. To this day it\u2019s still my favourite movie.\n\nTL:DR; I was having an awful week for even a 4/5 year old, found the TMNT 2007 movie and it became my comfort movie to even this day.",

    "body": "This movie is basically why I still have my Disney+ subscription lol. I love every second of it. Can quote every line. Look forward to the gypsy fight scene *every time* lol. \n\nIt's just a really nice take on the classic Cinderella story, and I love how it gave all the secondary characters such depth. \n\nFor instance, the stepmother was classically cruel, but beneath the capricious quips, there were moments that showed her flaws and fears. She hinted to Danielle that her mother had held her to impossible standards, always telling her she wasn't clean enough, and presumably grooming her all her life to attract the right kind of suitor. \n\nAfter years under her mother's intense eye, she managed to marry someone with royal blood (although it's not clear if, in this story, she was born to that caste as well), and live the life she was trained for. \n\nOnly to suddenly find herself widowed with two daughters. I can only imagine the desperation she must have felt to find a new husband quickly, and how it must have cost her to marry outside the royal sphere. How she must have consoled herself with the fact that he was at least young (enough to have a daughter younger than hers) and an enterprising, ambitious business man (which meant money and health). She must have felt so secure and safe again... \n\nOnly for him to die as well so soon after they were married? My god, when she begs Gustav not to leave her alone, presumably because she not only knew she'd be vulnerable in a new place that she didn't yet know but also because it wouldn't look good to have two dead husbands to her name, my heart breaks. She had to take on the mantel of running a home by herself, in a new place, as well as yet *another* daughter who would need to be raised well and groomed for marriage just as she was... \n\nAnd that's just one character lol. So much context in such a little movie. That's why it's brilliant and one of my all-time favorites. \ud83e\udd70",
