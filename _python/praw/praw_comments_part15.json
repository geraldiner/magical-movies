The 2005 one.\n\nEveryone likes to trash it because of how much more weird it was than the original, but that's what I loved about it. \n\nWilly wonka has an interesting backstory, grandpa joe isn't an asshole worthy of r/grandpajoehate, and the factory is so much cooler. Charlie imo is just as good in both versions. One of the few things I prefer in the original is the music.\n\nI would guess the original version is considered better by a lot of people because it's more \"real,\" but a lot of people forget that both movies, being based off a children's book, are also meant for children",
