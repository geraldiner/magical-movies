One time a kid ducked his swing and he wound up smacking this kid in the face with a hockey stick lmao. The whole class cheered.

  "body": "FACTS!!! \nI don't remember where I read this, but there are a few reasons why Frollo is so fucking scary. He is not like any other villan in the Disney Renaissance, or any other Disney movie. He doesn't have any crazy powers; he is 100% human. \n\nImo \"Hellfire\" was the best song from any Disney soundtrack from the 90s (if not ever). Lets explore this for a minute. He's a small man begging God for help while he's at the brink of giving in completely to his inner evil-Ness (idk another word to use, just pretend it's a word). He knows he shouldn't give in to his (sexual) urges, but deep down, he knows exactly what he'll do when he leaves that room tomorrow morning. Yet here he is, literally asking for forgiveness from God for the awful things he's going to do to not just Esmeralda, but the entire fucking city. \n\nI myself am a recovering addict (don't worry I'm doing great now- I'm just using this fact to make a point). This is a thought process we have every single day with ourselves, multiple times a day: all you can think about is the one thing you know you can't have again- or else, you'll be playing Russian Roulette with not just your life, but the lives of everyone around us. What Frollo is going thru (not the rape-y stuff but the struggle itself) is so fucking human. It's relatable. \n\nAddict or not, we've all fought and wrestled with our emotions, things we \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" think or ponder on. We've all struggled to accept our thoughts, feelings at some point. The difference between us and him is that he pushed himself over the cliff into darkness. HIS darkness. And yet we've all given in to our urges even when we know it's wrong. (Hopefully, unlike him, you've learned some successful coping skills over time!)\n\nWe also try to paint ourselves as the victim. We blame everything and everyone else except us because personal responsibility to us would mean confronting, processing and quitting our addiction- and we're mortified by the thought of this- so it's much easier to blame everyone else and make yourself the victim. Frollo can't stop repeating, \"It's not my fault\" and gives excuses why he shouldn't be held accountable for his lustful thoughts and violent actions. In response to the archdeacon when he's calling him out for literally murdering his mom, he says, \"I am guiltless. She ran, I pursued....my conscience is clear.\"\n\nSo when he's \"forced\" to raise Quasi, he's only doing it so he can use him as a slave, pawn, and sacrifice. Quasi is Frollo's way of keeping face and giving him another reason to feel self righteous. He is a master manipulator, willing to shatter his adopted \"son's\" psyche to get what he wants (i put son in parentheses because he never truly viewed quasi like a son). He's constantly gaslighting him, reminding him that he didn't have to take him in- but he did so out of the \"kindness of his heart.\"  (Idk if that's what he says but you know what I mean). He literally teaches him the mantra \"I'm am deformed. I am ugly-\" then\"you are my one defender.\" Frollo be self-righteous AF. \n\nAlso: Disney villains may want to rule the world, but what they really want to is hurt or punish the protagonist. Frollo is an elected official that is openly advocating for murder and genocide. He is willing to destroy the city by inciting violence and causing millions in property damage in order to find the people he hates and kill them. We watched a very similar situation play out in January on live television. We also see what's happening within the  QANON and GOP crowds. \n\nAnyway, TL;DR Frollo is scary because he has some human qualities we can relate to. Alternatively, he's a gaslighting abuser that's itching to exterminate an entire ethnic group- and always has an excuse to defend his actions. He's remarkably human compared to other Disney villains from that Era. Didn't mean to write a wall of text but here I am.",

She's tough, but she's got a heart of gold, maybe. The sort of character you'd expect to be played by Michelle Rodriguez. And then in the film they're like, and here's Gomez! And it's a little guy with a moustache. It's great.",

Was hard avoiding spoilers back then but it was still everything it was hyped up to be and more..  It was literally all anyone could talk about for months it seemed.  It also catapulted Spielberg from a great director to truly iconic and a cultural figure.\n\nIt was a cinematic marvel at the time.  The acting wasn't amazing but it was very believable.  The action scenes were very realistic feeling.  The casting was amazing.  The soundtrack was obviously an instant classic, easily top 5 most recognizable theme melodies but I suppose that's what happens when you have the goat John Williams score your films.  But the special effects..  guys... especially all you youngsters.  There was just something about the mixture of CGI and animatronics that was so fresh at the time.  Nobody had really done a dinosaur movie of that scale and budget until then.  Also the flick still surprisingly holds up.",
