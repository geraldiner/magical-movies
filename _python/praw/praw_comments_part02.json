The scene near the end on the mountain remains my favorite scene in any movie ever. I also love how this movie uses its obvious product placement as a major part of the character and plot. Papa Johns is what he worked after his father died and E Harmony is where we connect with Walter and his awkward shy nature. Also Patton Oswald voices the support guy and is great. It also ends up saving Walters ass in the end. I LOVE this \u201cbad\u201d movie!",

The film is one of my all time favorites, even though people tend to trash on it cause of the goofier humor from Eddie Murphy and that it isnt scary. I love it so much, no complaints haha! I think all the characters are fun, the hitchhiking ghosts cameos were fun, the singing busts also were fun. And I absolutely love the score by Mark Mancina. 10/10 movie for me!</p>\n</div>",

Also I am here for the majestic flying sequences carried solely by the score. Speaking of the score, i think the trilogy's is the single best score of any movie or franchise ever, come at me. The way it handles its characters and plot is really good. The villain is fantastic, his introduction is a really good establishment scene, and the soundtrack during perfectly captures it. I should probably stop here before I go off about the score even more",

Of course, all the stupid jokes are hella annoying but when you look beyond them you find the beautiful story of a group of girls learning to sing together. The scene where Aubrey finally lets Beca be the leader and they find their sound by singing Just The Way You Are is absolutely magical. Also, the scene in the second movie where they sit around the campfire and start singing When I'm Gone is magnificent, makes me tear up every time.\n\n2. The Greatest Showman. Another kind of Musical Film, another masterpiece. The story of PT pursuing his dream is just so amazing. All the songs are incredibly good, the ending of From Now On makes me shiver from its sheer beauty every time I watch it. And obviously, Hugh Jackman is absolutely slaying it as PT.\n\n3. Revenge of the Sith. This to me is the single greatest movie of all time. The pace is wonderfully fast. The opening shot alone absolutely blew my mind when I saw it for the first time... Just two starfighters flying past a Venator over Coruscant and BAM there's actually a huge battle going on underneath. Peak cinematography. And then, over the course of the movie, seeing Palpatines schemes and manipulation of the senate more and more clearly, witnessing Anakin dwindling more and more towards the Dark Side and then... Order 66, makes me cry every single time. That leads up to what is in my opinion the greatest final showdown of any movie ever, the battle of brothers, Anakin and Obi-Wan facing off in literal hell, Obi-Wan just struggling to stay alive against Anakins onslaught. And then the incredibly beautiful parallel scene of Vader being rebuilt while Padm\u00e9 is dying.\nIt's just so perfect in literally every way",

Ben Stiller and Robin Williams' acting still holds up, and while I have a deeper appreciation for better directed and classically constructed films, NATM will hold a special place in my heart forever.",

    "body": "Joe Vs The Volcano. \n\nI've seen this movie probably 100 times (so much that even the DVD started to wear in spots.) I'll never forget my dad introducing it to me or the month-long process we spent tracking down a buyable copy after we had rented it from Netflix when they were an all mail service. \n\nWe had tracked the only way to buy it a Best Buy online listing only they had 1 copy left and it ended up being faster to call the random store in the mid-west to get it shipped. I'll never forget about the 5th or 6th time I watched it just being incapacitated during the scene with the clearly fake hammerhead shark as in I couldn't breathe between the laughter. \n\nMost people haven't even heard of it and would only recognize the two leads from their later works but I can still quote nearly every scene word for word. I constantly quote it back without realizing it with my favorite being the \"office phone argument\" where the boss is on the phone talking in circles about \"I know he can get the job, but can he do the job...Maybe...Maybe...Maybe...I didn't say that. I didn't say that, if I would have said that I would've been wrong! I KNOW HE CAN GET THE JOB, BUT CAN HE DO THE JOB?!\" \n\nThe opening credits and the cover of '16 Tons' set the humdrum factory vibe so well along with all the ridiculous signs and details/symbols you see repeated throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks is great as the lead but even better is Meg Ryan playing three wildly different characters all with Joe (Tom Hanks) slightly confused if this is the same person or any of this is real.\n\nEvery interaction Joe has with people in the city after being told his \"diagnosis\" is golden from hugging a random Great Dane to hiring a clear Driving Miss Daisy spoof leading to a great montage for the classic transformative makeover. The scene during this sequence lands for it's finale with a luggage salesman that I think is the best scene set on a sales floor ever made.\n\nI could go on and on but I really don't think I'll ever outgrow this movie even if I don't watch it twice a week anymore.",
