There\u2019s scenes in this movie that make me reflect on how wonderful childhood was in some ways- such as learning the 7 magical secrets only children know (you lose these when you start to think about sex though).

I had a fantastic time rewatching it and it was a load of fun.\n\nLast summer I had talked enough about it for my sister to accept renting it so we could watch it together. We both grew up on musicals so she had expectations that... weren\u2019t met BUT by the end she was rooting for the characters.\n\n4th time I saw it was a month or two ago when I convinced my grandmother to watch it. She was fully underwhelmed.\n\nThe movie is seriously flawed, the crunch, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, the lack of a single Asian character outside of a background dancer, animation issues, plot issues/holes, weird character choices, and a bunch of other things plague it. Even so, it\u2019s a super fun movie to watch and I wish more people had at least watched it before completely disregarding it. \nThe characters are fun, Taylor Swift did a pretty good job, Jason Derulo looks like he\u2019s having the time of his life, the music is mostly great, and Skimlbleshanks is the love of my life now. \n\nIf you\u2019re ever bored I would recommend checking it out!",

We popped and then started watching the movie. 20 mins in, we were already laughing but we were fine until those 20 mins passed and the acid hadn't hit. After that point on though we slowly started feeling the trip hit, and i vividly remember we totally fucking lost it at the part where Zach is doing the wanking action on Carlos. And from there, we were just laughing, contagious laughing, all kinds of laughing to the point where we had to stop the movie and take a breather with some 10-15 mins of the movie still to go. So anyway, sober or not, that shit is magical to me and it will always be lol.",
