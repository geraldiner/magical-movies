  "body": "I think all of the things that made the first avatar so appealing are the reasons I\u2019m excited for its sequels more than anything.\n\nLike the appeal of the first was how the movie used new technology to tell an make an original adventure film in a world we\u2019ve not seen before with its own species, wildlife, culture, futuristic tech, language, etc. So part of the movie wanting to showcase all those things meant that the story had to suffer and had to be simplified as a result just so the story could be a means to introduce and explore the world rather than the story being the main focus. That\u2019s kinda a contrast to previous James Cameron movies where they\u2019re set in worlds we\u2019re already familiar with or they\u2019re never really introducing a whole new big universe (eg Aliens and T2 were sequels set in worlds we\u2019re already familiar with, Titanic has a premise and background people are already familiar with from the real titanic, not to mention The Abyss, Titanic and Aliens all take place on just one ship/one closed location..and the two Terminator films only have a few locations involved as the plot moves from A to B...none of Cameron\u2019s previous films try to flesh out an entire world and mythos like Avatar did).\n\nSo I think Avatar was different from Cameron\u2019s previous movies in terms of ambition and scope and that was maybe why it\u2019s not loved by many viewers because it grossed so much but only felt like an introduction to a world that should be explored further rather than feeling like a movie that was meant to be a satisfactory standalone self contained film. And in a decade where people have seen the Marvel movies hint at a wider universe and then pump out sequels which flesh out that whole universe like Avatar promised to do...then I guess that\u2019s why Avatar has become less popular as the years have gone by.\n\nBut all of those are reasons I\u2019m looking forward to the avatar sequels. There\u2019s no extra baggage or reasons to waste time setting anything up or holding the viewer\u2019s hand, I have no idea which direction the plot will go either..so it won\u2019t be Fern Gully again and it\u2019ll be something unexpected I assume, plus I don\u2019t know who the new characters will be like Kate Winslet either, and ultimately it\u2019ll be movies from one of the best filmmakers of all time who\u2019s the master of sequels too and it\u2019ll be something he\u2019s been working on for decades as he\u2019s worked on no other movies in the last +10 years...so the Avatar sequels only seem like promising prospects rather than movies that I\u2019d expect people to be reluctant in viewing.\n\nI say this as someone who didn\u2019t love the first avatar movie anyway. I didn\u2019t love it, didn\u2019t hate it. I didn\u2019t think it was a modern classic like that reviewer you posted did...but the one thing I did love was the movie\u2019s potential and I hope the potential can be met with the sequels.",

New Orleans was not established until 1718. When they speak of 'the Americas' they are likely referring to Spanish holdings, likely in the Caribbean, as it was still early in the colonization process in Mexico and South America for them to be referring to those places.

I believe the Spanish governor of Peru established a penal colony in the mid 17th century.
