Great cast, we got King Robert(Mark Addy) from GoT, The Joker(Heath Ledger) from Dark Knight, Vision(Paul Bettany) from MCU and last but certainly not least Alan Tudyk from Firefly. The whole film was written as a satirical \"modern football romance/drama\" but set in medieval times replacing football for jousting. I absolutely love Heath Ledger and its nice to see him having fun in a film at such a young age. Paul Bettany chews every scene of dialog as Geoffrey Chaucer (\"A what? A writer!\") And Alan Tudyk is hysterical. Its incredibly heart-warming and just never gets old for me. It improves with age like a fine wine.",

Wasn't expecting anything great out of it, just hopefully something decent. When the credits began to roll I was just sitting there, feeling paralyzed. A movie so dread-inducing, so horrific to watch, and so bizzare. I loved it so much. I saw this back in November and I constantly think about it. I won't give much away, but it's such an ingenious film. This movie changed my life (and how I look at certain things).

I think they\u2019re great. \nPeople\u2019s main criticisms about them are the overuse of CGI and how much it strayed from the book.\n\nWhile it would have been cool had it stuck closer to the book. I think they made the right choice. The darker tone and feeling fit in better with the LOTR movies and the war of the ring. A more lighthearted children\u2019s movie would have felt out of place. They do a good job of explaining, elaborating, and expanding upon an already amazing movie franchise with a trilogy allowing characters to be properly fleshed out. They do this so well that I personally feel that the signature longing for the Shire and adventure from the end of Return of the King to be far greater.\nPeople complain about Smaug\u2019s size - in the book he was younger and a lot smaller as opposed to a 3 story building - but I also think that makes more sense. They needed a more believable reason to accompany Thrain\u2019s carelessness as to why a dragon was able to so easily infiltrate the mountain fortress.\n\nI understand how their overuse of CGI can be annoying, sometimes distracting, but I believe they deserve some slack given that the whole story was about dragons, mountains, and a gigantic multi-army battle. Plus, since the popularization of CGI, models as used in the LOTR series have gone by the wayside.\n\nMy only major critique is that it plays a bit like a prequel, which, as far as the movies go, they are. It really doesn\u2019t happen that much but there are times, such as the accompanying music at the reveal of the Morgul Blade in Rivendell, that feel a bit out of place without the context provided in the LOTR movies.",
