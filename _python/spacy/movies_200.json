The soundtrack never fails to give me shivers.  The Almost every single song has amazing tonal and key shifts - often bouncing from a major key and uplifting tone, to plummeting into darkness and dripping with animosity, or starting shy and apprehensive and swelling into triumph.  Mixing in actual hymns and Latin lyrics into the soundtrack was **chef's kiss**.\n\nBut you can't talk about Hunchback of Notre Dame without talking about Frollo.\n\nHe honestly leaves all other Disney villains in the dust imo - You've got Ursula, she wants to usurp the throne.  You've got Gaston, he just wants the girl.  You've got Jafar, who wants to usurp the throne.  You've got Scar, who wants to... usurp the throne (overused? Naaa).  You've got **literally Satan**.  Then there's Frollo, who is quite literally a genocidal maniac.  Frollo is such an abominable being.  He is *so sure* what he is doing is right and just, that he is ordained by his god, and he is *so wrong*.  He's terrifying.\n\nSorry for going off, I just really like this movie.",

  "comment_text": "Rear Window.  I think it is easily Hitchcock\u2019s best movie, and he made some great movies.  Jimmy Stewart is a sexy older man.  Grace Kelly makes you stop breathing when you first see her and she is awesome playing a gorgeous woman who is every bit as smart and adventurous as her boyfriend.  Thelma Ritter is a great character actor. The tension in the movie is almost unbearable and yet it is also full of great, light dialogue.  Every time you watch it something new jumps out at you.",

  "comment_text": "\"Inhale this but do not touch\"\n\n\"I smell nothing\"\n\n\"What you do not smell is called iocane powder, it is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more deadly poisons known to man\"\n\n\"Alright, where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun, it ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right, and who is dead\"\n\n\"but it's so simple, all I have to do divine from what I know of you, are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemies? Now a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he knows that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you! But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it! So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me!\"\n\n\"You've made your decision then?\"\n\n\"Not remotely! Because Iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to people not trusting them as you are not trusted by me so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you!\"\n\n\"truly you have a dizzying intellect.\"\n\n\"Wait 'til I get going! Where was I?\"\n\n\u201cAustralia\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder\u2019s origin so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me\"\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just stalling now\u201d\n\n\u201c you\u2019d like to think that wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201c you\u2019ve beaten my giant which means you\u2019re exceptionally strong so you could\u2019ve put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you\u2019ve also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal so you would\u2019ve put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to trick me into giving away something, it won\u2019t work\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has worked, you\u2019ve given everything away! I know where the poison is!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen make your choice\u201d\n\n\u201cI will and I choose, what in the world can that be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Where? I don\u2019t see anything\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I could have sworn I saw something, no matter\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a minute, first, let\u2019s drink! Me from my glass, and you, from yours\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guessed wrong\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only think I guessed wrong, that\u2019s what\u2019s so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned haha you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia but only slightly less well known is this! Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!\u201d",
