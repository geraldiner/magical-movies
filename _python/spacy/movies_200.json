In my opinion, it's one of the best pieces of art ever created.  Eternal Sunshine, though, has some draw that I can't describe, like I saw something very rare that few people will ever get to see (see, I can't describe it).  Every time I hear that Beck song from the closing credits, I almost feel that magic butterfly-tingle from the first time falling in love or something.",

Robert Duvall and Michael Caine play aging heroes; Haley Joel Osment plays a 12-year-old kid abandoned to them by a deadbeat mom.  \n\nAll three delivered really incredible performances.  It is to film sort of what \"Cannery Row\" is to the written word:  a gentle and loving look at what motivates truly adventurous and/or bizarre people.  I've seen it a half a dozen times -- it always transports me.",

I went to theatre only knowing that it was a dystopian sci-fi.  I had no clue of the plot, no clue it was based on a book, nothing.  When the huge revelation is revealed I was absolutely floored.  My jaw literally hung open and I was literally on the edge of my seat, captivated. I'd never felt like that before while watching a film.  And then the climatic scene, when everything stops as they walk past all the soldiers brought tears, and a sense of absolute awe.  Just an incredible, incredible film.",
