I was religiously renting it over and over again and I never talked to friends about it so it seemed like my little obscure discovery \n\nWhen I was.a little older, but still a child, and traveling I went into a goth shop and I saw some Jack Skellington artwork. I loudly said what it was to show to the store people that I \"get it\", like it was some insider reference. I was so proud but no one seemed that impressed although I thought they were my people...\n\nNot long later I realized it was this huge thing, widely popular across the world and definitely not a reflection of my profound tastes and insights. And that every hot shop and other goth stores have the artworks as a given\n\nIt very deeply disappointed me but I still think its magical. I just feel it was taken away from me :(",

When \"The Game Has Changed\" plays and the riders turn on their light-cycles energy trails as the build up rises for the first time. It's a scene forever burned into my mind.\n\n#Transformers\n\nImagine being me, an elementary school-aged kid and seeing Optimus Prime transform for the first time. I want to bottle that feeling up and drink it everyday. I became a Transformers fan on the spot because of that film, and I'm so glad I did, 14 years later.\n\n#Wall-E \n\nBest PIXAR movie **EVER**, fight me. The sense of wonder I felt when Wall�E and EVE were traversing the stars in dance was incredible. One of the best romantic scenes I've ever seen in a movie.",
