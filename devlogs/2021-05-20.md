Got over my fear of working with PRAW, and so far so good. I've been able to get the list of all the top-level comments and am extracting the info from the Reddit API. It was a little confusing to work with their data models, especially the `CommentForest` to get the replies to those top-level comments, but reading the documentation helped.

I think I might pause here to think about the data models I'll be using for my project. I remember watching CJ from (CodingGarden)[https://twitch.tv/codinggarden] work it out for one of his projects, and I think it would save some time in the future.

The major problem right now is that the top level comments have replies, which would be nice to display with the movies themselves (kinda like reviews). But what if they're not that relevant? I'd also thought about how every reply is just a comment, and I'd have a sort of recursive function getting information about comments until it came to one without replies.

But for the time being, I might just extract the text and author of the replies and display that with the movies.
