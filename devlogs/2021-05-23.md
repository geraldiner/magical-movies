I trained the AI on 150 and then 200 test cases to see how well it worked like that. There didn't seem to be that much of a difference between the two. And honestly, I'm pretty impressed on how well it worked. When I'd tried it in another small test, it didn't work (but this was with 20 test cases).

I think next is to figure out how to fix any that the AI misses. Or do I just have to make a batch of 500 or so test cases? ðŸ˜¨
