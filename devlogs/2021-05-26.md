## Training on ~300 cases

I was able to train the AI on a couple more cases. I added more 'real' cases and added the same empty cases to the end.
It still seems to be overfitting, or working too well, to pick out general proper nouns.

Especially for comments that go into detail about why the like it, the AI will pick out text that thinks is movies, but isn't.

As you can see, for test #9, there is a whole paragraph about the movie \*Excalibur", which wasn't detected. But other capitalized text was.

There is also something going on in test #11, where Pink Floyd is picked out but not "the Wall".

I'm not sure how to address this yet. It seems like my options are:

1. Manually check comments that don't get picked out correctly by the AI

2. Add to the training set information about other types of proper nouns (actors/actresses, directors, etc.)

   - I know there is a framework that could also do this. I'll have to research if it's possible to use something like the Natural Language ToolKit first and then my custom NER.

## Interesting Cases

I use "interesting" pretty loosely here. It's interesting in the sense that I didn't expect it, but now it's an issue.

#### Quotes as a Top-Level Comment

```
# Someone posted a quote from the movie (Galaxy Quest), which got upvotes.
# How would I account for stuff like this?

{
    "author": {
        "name": "Spiderfuzz",
        "avatar": "https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_dnoxe/styles/profileIcon_yelsee6ffuv61.png?width=256&height=256&crop=256:256,smart&s=ad74449c104a4500c7e0436801cbbe8d3c49b584",
    },
    "body": '"By Grabthar\'s Hammer!"',
    "body_html": '<div class="md"><p>&quot;By Grabthar&#39;s Hammer!&quot;</p>\n</div>',
    "comment_id": "gvm9glu",
    "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/mx0pwd/what_movie_is_simply_magical_to_you_no_matter_how/gvm9glu/",
    "replies": ["gvnr0uz"],
    "score": 15,
}
```

In the example above, the comment is just a quote from a movie (Galaxy Quest), which I only knew by looking it up. Does this count for the movie Galaxy Quest? It seems like it reasonably would. The real question is how many are actually like this?

#### Movies by their Series Name, Director, etc.

```
# Movies that come in a series that have been bunched up together

{
    "author": {
        "name": "B0ndzai",
        "avatar": "https://www.redditstatic.com/avatars/avatar_default_07_FFD635.png",
    },
    "body": "All of the Riddick movies.",
    "body_html": '<div class="md"><p>All of the Riddick movies.</p>\n</div>',
    "comment_id": "gvm2lme",
    "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/mx0pwd/what_movie_is_simply_magical_to_you_no_matter_how/gvm2lme/",
    "replies": ["gvmrr1b", "gvn7xu8", "gvmvdak", "gvn9rd6"],
    "score": 39,
}
```

There are also quite a few cases where people say something like, "Anything Studio Ghibli," or "All of the Star Wars movies." And I'm not quite sure how to handle this either. It might be that I manually add all those movies to my own models.

But for those that say something like "Pretty much all Terry Gilliam movies," do they really mean ALL of those movies. I can see that getting kind of tedious.

```

    "author": {
        "name": "phydeauxbreath",
        "avatar": "https://www.redditstatic.com/avatars/avatar_default_05_FF4500.png",
    },
    "body": "Pretty much all [Terry Gilliam movies](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/).",
    "body_html": '<div class="md"><p>Pretty much all <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/">Terry Gilliam movies</a>.</p>\n</div>',
    "comment_id": "gvlc6kj",
    "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/mx0pwd/what_movie_is_simply_magical_to_you_no_matter_how/gvlc6kj/",
    "replies": [...],
    "score": 117,
}
```

#### Potential non-magical movies

```
{
    "author": {
        "name": "Lunnyb_the_normalguy",
        "avatar": "https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_40lufj/styles/profileIcon_snooa86c292d-684a-4b4d-baf9-144f27d236bb-headshot.png?width=256&height=256&crop=256:256,smart&s=74d4a4dd7da94bc2a33438e0da80adf391f703a8",
    },
    "body": "The thing, i dont know why but its my favorite horror movie. i really love the movie.",
    "body_html": '<div class="md"><p>The thing, i dont know why but its my favorite horror movie. i really love the movie.</p>\n</div>',
    "comment_id": "gvls69x",
    "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/mx0pwd/what_movie_is_simply_magical_to_you_no_matter_how/gvls69x/",
    "replies": ["gvnjop7", "gvmlqdt"],
    "score": 37,
}
```

I am wondering if the original poster actually meant to post this. They specifically say it's their favorite horror movie. Which makes me keep thinking about what 'magic' really is. Is their understanding of magic something to be feared?

I remember reading about sentiment analysis, which could be something to explore in deciding whether to keep these kinds of comments or not, but for the time being, I'll keep it in.

## Wireframing

While I continue to collect all the top-level comments (3/4 of the way there!), I worked on a wireframe for the home page in Figma. While creating it, I began to think more seriously about what functionalit there would be in an MVP of this project.

So far I came up with:

- Log in/Sign Up/Log out
- Search for a movie to see if it made it on the list/was ever mentioned
- View the individual page for a movie

Users must be logged in to do the following:

- Give their own rating for the movie
- Upvote/Downvote any of the movies (which would then change their ranking)
- Add a movie to a personal "To Watch/Bookmarked" list
